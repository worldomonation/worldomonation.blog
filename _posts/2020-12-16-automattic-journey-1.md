I recently accepted an offer from Automattic, to join as a Senior Quality Engineer. I was inspired to write this by a fellow Automattician [DanQ](https://danq.me/2019/08/30/automattic-00/) whom kept meticulous notes. 

## Background

I had been a user of WordPress.com since 2009-2010, signing up when I decided to shut down my original Facebook account amidst concerns over privacy and data before those concerns were confirmed years later via [the scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal).

WordPress and Tumblr (and later, Twitter) took over various facets of my digital life and I ran a semi-successful anime/2D subculture blog for some time. When I set off for my internship however, the I put the blog on hiatus with intention of returning. That never happened.

Throughout this whole time, I had not been aware of who actually ran WordPress. It just was not something that crossed my mind while I delved into other hobbies and dove headfirst into the final year of my university.

A year or two after graduating university and while working at the first position I held out of university, an influential friend whom I met in first year suggested that I apply at Automattic. This was my first encounter. At the time, being a SQA engineer at a small local firm, the prospect of working remotely for a large multinational corporation seemed far-fetched and so I never applied. That's there the story ends. Or so I thought.

Until I was [laid off](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/) from Mozilla in August 2020 in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19. It was daunting enough to be unemployed, but on top of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, it was a real struggle every day.

## Application

On 2020-10-26 at 21:05 PDT, I sent in my application for a Senior Quality Engineer position I saw open on Automattic's career page. Little did I know this would be the first act in a fun and exciting journey.
