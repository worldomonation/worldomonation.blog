Around mid-October, I injured my left knee.

It was a stupid reason; I folded my left leg and sat onto it, as my couch is on the low side. When I did that, I felt (and possibly heard, but [memories cannot be trusted](https://medium.com/the-innovation/why-your-memory-cannot-be-trusted-e0a70feb63e4)) a pop in the left knee. Burning sensation followed soon after, close to the inner part of the knee.

Due to personal engagements I powered through the next three days which probably made the situation worse. By end of the week, the left knee was visibly swollen and it was not possible to walk.

At this point, there would be a hospital visit and a scan taken of the affected area, then a treatment plan follows. At least, that is how it would have been done in Japan.

Alas, that is not how healthcare in British Columbia operates.

I was given a requisition form for an ultrasound. As it turns out, ultrasounds can only be booked by physician's office, so it was pointless for me to call around. Physician's office called around various locations only to be told that _knee ultrasounds are not a thing_.

Okay, that's weird, but fine. I returned to the physician's office for another assessment, a week after the injury. We'll obtain an MRI scan instead, she said. British Columbia has been running their MRI machines [24 hours a day, 7 days a week](https://vancouversun.com/news/politics/b-c-touts-success-of-new-mri-strategy-but-lacks-wait-time-proof/) since 2018 and so I stated my availability to be any time of the day, any day of the week, at any location in the Lower Mainland.

Now, nearly 3 weeks after the injury, the MRI scan is yet to materialize, I could not walk for two weeks and turns out a good physiotherapist (out-of-the-pocket ) can do wonders. 

The notion of Universal Healthcare is wonderful; everyone has equal and fair access to care. Unfortunately, the reality is that care is often slow and leads to issues worsening during the wait time, or quality of life deteriorating significantly while the system continuousy experiences a backlog.

I consider myself lucky as I have employer-paid extended healthcare benefits that cover physiotherapy. Without it (like many Canadians), expenses of physiotherapy would have been prohibitive.

Defenders of the current healthcare system in Canada vigorously criticize any attempts to introduce private clinics as step towards American-style healthcare; but **reality is that we already do have a multi-tier system**, just disguised under extended health benefit system.

Earlier, I mentioned Japan for a reason; there, patients are expected to [co-pay 30% of the cost](https://healthytokyo.com/blog/cost-of-medical-care-in-japan/). Right off the bat this is a much fairer system as typically 80% of the care goes towards the same 20% of the people. Those utilizing the system more are expected to chip in to pay for the doctors, nurses and equipment. Use more, pay more (but not so much it breaks your bank). Sounds good to me.

Ultimately I do not claim to have the answer to our healthcare problems; taxing residents more every year is not the solution, nor is moving to an American-style system. There isn't a single pre-packaged solution; but moving to a copay system capped at some reasonable cost would provide much-needed external capital into the healthcare system and hopefully lead to a system that prioritizes care early on instead of continually playing catch-up.
