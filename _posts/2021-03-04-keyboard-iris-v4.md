On the last week of February, I picked up this Keebio Iris v4 in my first foray into the ergo keyboard _and_ ortholinear lifestyle.

It has Gateron Ink Black switches, lubed with Krytox 205g0 and encased in a 3D-printed case with translucent sides for _dat underglow_.

So far, really liking it. After spending a couple of days my typing speed increased from a low of 15wpm back up to around 40-50wpm. Still slower than the peak 80wpm I measured on my staggered QWERTY layout, but more than enough for daily typing.

I can sense something inside me wanting to now build my own keyboards next...maybe Kailh Box Jade switches next?
