Recently I purchased a set of HK Gaming Chalk keycaps. 

It's a well made, Cherry-profile keycaps with 139 keys (108 ANSI + 31 modifiers). 1.4mm thick PBT, dye sublimated legends. Not the cream of the crop, but definitely not super cheap ABS keycaps either.

The keyboard on the other hand, is a budget model keyboard that I purchased back in 2016 while working at my first job out of university - the **TeamWolf Zhuque+**.

It's a USB-A tenkeyless mechanical keyboard that retailed on Banggood for about $60USD around 2015-2016. It came with Outemu Blue switches, a clicky-type switch notorious for the high-pitched clacking it produced - and it is LOUD. Checkout some videos on YouTube if you don't believe me. I think I nearly drove a colleague insane typing on this keyboard in office.

It may be just me, but the mechanical keyboard scene was much smaller then. A $60USD mechanical keyboard was quite something already, but the TeamWolf Zhuque+ had another trick up its sleeve; it is fully hotswappable, with standard plate mount and LEDs poking through a hole in the PCB. All this for less than a night out at the club (remember that?). It was the perfect gateway keyboard.

In 2017 I swapped in some Gateron Brown switches from Massdrop for office use. But otherwise, the keyboard stayed the same, the gamer-font keycaps and all.

Now, half a decade after I first bought the keyboard I finally purchased some nicer keycaps that it really deserved. 

Looks much nicer now, doesn't it?

It's not the best keyboard out there, nor is it the fanciest. It will never win awards for build quality. The cable will fail one day and I won't be able to revive it.

But it's a keyboard that has stuck with me through 4 jobs helping me to make a living and it has never failed me once.

I may now be eyeing fancier, ergonomic keyboards now, but this one will always stay and my children will likely learn software development on it one day.

Take care of your things, and it will take care of you.
