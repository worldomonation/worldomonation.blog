In [Part 1]({% post_url 2020-12-16-automattic-journey-1 %}) I was several weeks out from beginning my first day with Automattic.

This week, I became a full-time employee.

Opening slack, I now had access to all channels and people - it felt like an entirely new experience.

## Vacation
##### _2020-12-11 to 2020-12-27_

I decided to take approximately 3 weeks off prior to starting. I highly recommend all new hires to take at least 3 weeks off and more if they can manage it. Previously I have only taken at most 1 week off and that left me tired and not quite mentally ready to start. I find it crucial to fully reset between gigs.

With Automattic, it's extra useful to have some time off because of the next point.

## Onboarding
##### _2020-12-11 to 2020-12-27_

There were some basic onboarding steps that trickled in between signing of the offer letter and the actual start date.

Things like setting up my @automattic.com email address or being added to the GitHub organization - lots of administrative tasks. But perhaps the most important series of email revolves around the Support Rotation onboarding. Support Rotation is where all new hires - regardless of position - are required to complete a two-week stint as Happiness Engineer, interacting with the actual users of WordPress. The idea is to build empathy and understanding of the product.

## First week
##### _2020-12-28_

The first week is a firehose of information. The Support Rotation kicks in full swing from Day 1, with self-paced studies continuing until Day 3. By Day 3/4 you're expected to be working on live ticket with a training buddy. Having super admin control over 40% of world's sites is rather scary.

On top of that, it has been many years since I directly interacted with customers through support, and it is truly an eye-opener to not only how many different requests come through, but also just how difficult the Happiness Engineer's jobs are. 

In between digesting the torrent of new information, I made sure to order my new hardware - a M1 MacBook Pro 13", fully decked out with 1TB SSD and 16GB RAM. I'm excited to be one of the early adopters of Apple's next big thing. If only [Best Buy would stop cancelling](https://twitter.com/TakahashiEdwin/status/1344538170013097985) my order for a Lenovo ThinkVision P32u-10 because of some unknown reason, that would be great. _EDIT_: looks like my second order with them has also been cancelled without explanation. They really do not want my business it seems.

## Looking back

As I write this, I am wrapping up my first week as an Automattician. Starting a new job is always daunting and during a pandemic, even more so. But all individuals I have interacted with so far at Automattic - from the HR Wranglers to my training buddy and everyone in between - has made me feel right at home and hugely supportive. I couldn't imagine a better organiztion to start with.

I look forward to Week 2 when I will jump into live chat. It will definitely be an interesting experience.
