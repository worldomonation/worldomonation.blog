In [Part 1]({% post_url 2020-12-16-automattic-journey-1 %}) I was several weeks out from beginning my first day with Automattic.

Today, I became a full-time employee.

Opening slack, I now had access to all channels and people - it felt like an entirely new experience.

## Vacation
##### _2020-12-11 to 2020-12-27_

I decided to take approximately 3 weeks off prior to starting. I highly recommend all new hires to take at least 3 weeks off and more if they can manage it. Previously I have only taken at most 1 week off and that left me tired and not quite mentally ready to start. I find it crucial to fully reset between gigs.

With Automattic, it's extra useful to have some time off because of the next point.

## Onboarding
##### _2020-12-11 to 2020-12-27_

There were some basic onboarding steps that trickled in between signing of the offer letter and the actual start date.

Things like setting up your @automattic.com email address, being added to the GitHub organization but the most important email is regarding the Support Rotation onboarding. Support Rotation is where all new hires - regardless of position - are required to complete a two-week stint as Happiness Engineer, interacting with the actual users of WordPress. It's a lot to learn.
