I've settled on this new home screen for the last week.

The terminal-esque widget is a slightly tweaked version of the one that comes with [Widgy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widgy/id1524540481). The free tier is quite excellent; check it out.

Otherwise, some of the icons have been shuffled around but no major changes from my previous homescreen.
